# Neptune
Fluid Springboard for iOS 12.

**Credits**: MidnightChips (Developer of [HomeGesture](https://github.com/midnightchip/midnightchip.github.io))

###### Version
1.0 beta 3
###### Compatibility
Requires iOS 12.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone 7 and 8, currently untested on other devices.

## New Features

- Lock screen quick toggles now display! On devices without 3D Touch, you can simply tap and hold to enable.

- Screen corners are now rounded system wide (same anti-aliasing method that the iPhone X uses to round corners).

- An even smoother corner radius animation when entering the app switcher.

## Fixed Issues

- A switcher snapshot corner radius override was causing corners to render incorrectly when exiting apps from the switcher to the home screen. This is now fixed.

- Some other minor bug visual glitches fixed.

## Known Issues

- Home indicator overlaps Tab Bar labels and the keyboard in applications if enabled. This issue cannot be fixed until rootlessJB3 offers access to applications. Please don't bother the developer of rootlessJB3, as it won't accelerate the developement process.

**Workaround:** Use the version of Neptune that does not include the home indicator.

- The dock is not sized properly on the iPhone SE. This will be fixed in a future update. (Likely in a revised version of beta 3)

- Beta 3 has not been tested on iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone SE.

Fixes are planned for all of these issues. No eta at the moment.

A preference pane is in the works, so I can offer the option to change the screenshot buttons and toggle the dock, home indicator and lock screen buttons. No eta. I am not expecting to have this done very soon, I have exams coming up :( In the meantime, there will be two alternate packages up to use the volume up + side button for screenshots.
