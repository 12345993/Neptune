## New Features

- Neptune now has a full preferences section in the Settings app, with a fancy new icon!

- Neptune can now be enabled in all applications.

- Picture in Picture is now enabled system wide.

- The keyboard is now styled as on the iPhone X and up. I am planning to add an option to adjust this height in the future.

- The media controls button in Control Center now adopts a new transition from iOS 12.2 beta 2.

- The modern status bar is now enabled in all applications. In order to prevent bugs, in non-Apple apps it is shorter in height. This can be disabled in Settings.

## Fixed Issues

- Icons are no longer vertically compressed on the home screen.

- The time on the cover sheet no longer overlaps the search bar on the widgets screen.

## Known Issues

- Status bar does not transition properly in certain applications. This transition bug can be fixed by enabling the tall status bar system wide (beta).

- The dock is not sized properly on the iPhone SE. This will be fixed in a future update.

- Beta 5 has not been tested on iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone SE, and may have minor visual bugs.

Fixes are planned for all of these issues. No eta at the moment. If you find any issues, please report them in the "Issues" section, so that I can label them and track them!
